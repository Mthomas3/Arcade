					<h2>What have we done?</h2>
					<p>We had to make two games during this project, our first game is Snake and our second game is Pacman.
					<br />We also had to develop our two games with three different libraries and so we decided to use the SFML library, Ncurses and Ogre3D. 
					</p>

					<h2>Why have we chose this games?</h2>
					<p>
Our first game is snake because we felt that this was game too important to ignore as we are used to playing it from a young age. <br />Hence it is the reason why we found it interesting to make.
<br />Our second game that we made is Pacman. Like Snake it's an unavoidable game as well but we also think it's the coolest game of them all.
					</p>

					<h2>Question?</h2>
					<p> If you have any problem or any questions about our project, please feel free to
contact us, we would love to help you as best we can
